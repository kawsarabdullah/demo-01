                <table>

                    <p>Am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to
                        see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I
                        like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the
                        moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming
                        from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought
                        experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in
                        summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I
                        like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’
                        noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I
                        like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the
                        land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.

                        I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman
                        Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their
                        books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could
                        read people’s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who
                        does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
